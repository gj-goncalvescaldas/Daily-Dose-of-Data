You're given a table containing the item count for each order on Alibaba, along with the frequency of orders that have the same item count.

Retrieve the mode of the order occurrences. If there are multiple item counts with the same mode, the results should be sorted in ascending order.



\*\*Clarifications:\*\*  

\- `item\_count`: Represents the number of items sold in each order.  

\- `order\_occurrences`: Represents the frequency of orders with the corresponding number of items sold per order.
