# 10182_Number_of_Streets_Per_Zip_Code

## Problem Description

Count the number of **unique street names** for each **postal code** in the `sf_restaurant_health_violations` dataset.

Only consider the **first word** of the `business_address` as the street name. This should be **case insensitive**â€”e.g., "FOLSOM" and "Folsom" are considered the same.

Additionally, if the address structure is reversed (e.g., "Pier 39" and "39 Pier"), treat them as referring to the **same street**.

Return a result with:
- `postal_code`
- `num` (number of unique street names)

The output should be **ordered** by:
1. Number of streets (`num`) in **descending** order
2. `postal_code` in **ascending** order
