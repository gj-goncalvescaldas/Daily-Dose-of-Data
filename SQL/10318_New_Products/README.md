Calculate the net change in the number of products launched by each company in the year 2020 compared to 2019.

You are given a table `car_launches` that contains the following columns:
- `company_name`: Name of the company.
- `product_name`: Name of the product launched.
- `year`: Year when the product was launched.

Your task is to determine, for each company, the **net difference** in the number of products launched in 2020 versus 2019.  
(Net difference = Number of products launched in 2020 - Number launched in 2019)

The output should include:
- `company_name`
- `total_launch`: the calculated net difference for each company
