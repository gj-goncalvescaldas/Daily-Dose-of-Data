# 10548_Top_Actor_Ratings_by_Genre

Determine the top actors based on their average movie rating within the genre they appear in most frequently.

For each actor:
- Identify their most frequent genre (i.e., the one theyâ€™ve appeared in the most).
- If there's a tie in genre count, choose the genre with the highest average rating for that actor.
- If there's still a tie in both count and rating, include all tied genres.

Then:
- Rank the resulting actor + genre pairs by their average rating in descending order.
- Return all actor + genre pairs that fall within the top 3 ranks (not just rows), including ties.
- Do not skip ranks; ties share the same rank, and the next rank follows sequentially.
