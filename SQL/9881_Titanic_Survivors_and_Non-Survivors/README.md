# 9881_Titanic_Survivors_and_Non-Survivors

Make a report showing the number of survivors and non-survivors grouped by passenger class from the Titanic dataset.

Each passenger belongs to one of the following classes:
- First class: `pclass = 1`
- Second class: `pclass = 2`
- Third class: `pclass = 3`

The goal is to display the count of passengers who survived and those who did not, broken down by each class.

**Table:** `titanic`

**Relevant columns:**
- `survived`: Indicates survival (1 if survived, 0 otherwise)
- `pclass`: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3)
