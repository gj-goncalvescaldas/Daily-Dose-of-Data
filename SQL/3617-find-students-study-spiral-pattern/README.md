## Description

Write a solution to find students who follow the **Study Spiral Pattern** â€” students who consistently study multiple subjects in a rotating cycle.

- A **Study Spiral Pattern** means a student studies **at least 3 different subjects** in a repeating sequence.  
- The pattern must repeat for at least **2 complete cycles** (minimum 6 study sessions).  
- Study sessions must occur on **consecutive dates with no gaps longer than 2 days**.  
- For students that meet the pattern:
  - Calculate the **cycle length** (number of different subjects in the pattern).  
  - Calculate the **total study hours** across all sessions in the pattern.  
- Only include students with a cycle length of at least 3.  
- Return the result table ordered by:
  1. `cycle_length` (descending)  
  2. `total_study_hours` (descending)

## Schema

### Table: `students`
| Column Name  | Type    |
|--------------|---------|
| student_id   | int     |
| student_name | varchar |
| major        | varchar |

- `student_id` is the unique identifier for this table.  
- Each row contains information about a student and their academic major.  

### Table: `study_sessions`
| Column Name   | Type    |
|---------------|---------|
| session_id    | int     |
| student_id    | int     |
| subject       | varchar |

## Explanation

- **Alice Chen (student_id = 1):**  
  - Sequence: Math â†’ Physics â†’ Chemistry â†’ Math â†’ Physics â†’ Chemistry  
  - Cycle length = 3 subjects  
  - 2 complete cycles (6 sessions)  
  - Total study hours = 15.0  

- **Bob Johnson (student_id = 2):**  
  - Sequence: Algebra â†’ Calculus â†’ Statistics â†’ Geometry â†’ Algebra â†’ Calculus â†’ Statistics â†’ Geometry  
  - Cycle length = 4 subjects  
  - 2 complete cycles (8 sessions)  
  - Total study hours = 26.0  

- **Excluded students:**  
  - Carol Davis: only 2 subjects (fails â‰¥3 subjects rule).  
  - David Wilson: only 2 sessions with a 4-day gap (fails date continuity rule).  
  - Emma Brown: no sessions.  

The results are sorted by `cycle_length` **descending**, then `total_study_hours` **descending**.

## Solution Explanation

1. **Identifying gaps (`date_gaps`)**  
   For each studentâ€™s study session, compare the date with the previous session.  
   If the difference is greater than 2 days, mark it as a gap (a break in the sequence).  
   This helps identify where continuous study blocks start and end.  

2. **Grouping consecutive sessions (`consecutive_groups`)**  
   Accumulate the gap markers over time.  
   Each time a gap is found, a new group of consecutive sessions begins.  
   As a result, each studentâ€™s study history is split into continuous blocks (no breaks > 2 days).  

3. **Numbering sessions within groups (`session_sequences`)**  
   Within each consecutive block, order sessions by date.  
   Assign a sequential number (ROW_NUMBER): 1, 2, 3, â€¦  
   This prepares the sequence for cycle detection.  

4. **Selecting spiral candidates (`spiral_candidates`)**  
   For each consecutive block, calculate:  
   - Total number of sessions  
   - Number of distinct subjects  
   - Total hours studied  
   Keep only blocks that:  
   - Have â‰¥ 3 different subjects  
   - Have â‰¥ 6 sessions (minimum needed for 2 full cycles).  

5. **Validating cycle requirements (`pattern_validation`)**  
   Compute the cycle length = number of distinct subjects.  
   Verify at least 2 complete cycles exist:  
   - Example: 3 subjects â†’ need at least 6 sessions.  
   Only keep blocks meeting this rule.  

6. **Checking cycle repetition (`cycle_verification`)**  
   Confirm the subject sequence actually repeats.  
   Compare subjects from the first cycle with the next:  
   - Session 1 = Session 1 + cycle_length  
   - Session 2 = Session 2 + cycle_length  
   - â€¦ and so on.  
   If all align, the spiral pattern is confirmed.  

7. **Final result**  
   For each valid student:  
   - Output student ID, name, major, cycle length, and total hours.  
   - Order results by:  
     1. Longer cycles first (descending)  
     2. More study hours next (descending).
