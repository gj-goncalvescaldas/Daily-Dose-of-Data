### üìÑ Question

You‚Äôre a consultant for a major pizza chain that will be running a promotion where all 3-topping pizzas will be sold for a fixed price, and are trying to understand the costs involved.

Given a list of pizza toppings, consider all the possible 3-topping pizzas, and print out the total cost of those 3 toppings. Sort the results with the highest total cost on the top followed by pizza toppings in ascending order.

üìù **Constraints & Notes**:
- Do not include combinations with repeated toppings (e.g., ‚ÄòPepperoni,Pepperoni,Onion‚Äô).
- Toppings must be alphabetically ordered in output (e.g., `'Chicken,Onions,Sausage'` not `'Onion,Sausage,Chicken'`).
- Ensure proper formatting with no extra spaces between ingredient names.
- Sort results by `total_cost DESC`, then alphabetically by the first, second, and third topping.

### ‚úÖ Example Explanation

There are four valid 3-topping combinations using the available toppings. For example:

- `'Chicken,Pepperoni,Sausage'` = $0.55 + $0.50 + $0.70 = **$1.75**
- Combinations are ordered alphabetically by toppings, and sorted by cost descending.
