\- `transaction\_date` (timestamp): Date of the transaction



Your task is to identify the \*\*top two highest-grossing products\*\* within \*\*each category\*\* in the year \*\*2022\*\*. Grossing is based on the \*\*total spend\*\* on a product.

Only transactions from the year 2022 should be considered.
