### 10308_Salaries_Differences

Calculate the absolute difference between the highest salaries in the **marketing** and **engineering** departments. The final output should only include one column showing the salary difference.

You are provided with two tables:

- `db_employee`: Contains information about each employee, including their `id`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `salary`, and `department_id`.
- `db_dept`: Contains department details, with each `id` corresponding to a department name (`department`).

The goal is to identify the highest salary in both the marketing and engineering departments and compute the absolute difference between them. The result should be a single value representing this difference.
