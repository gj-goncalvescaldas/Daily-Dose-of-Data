**HackerRank â€” Print Prime Numbers**

**Problem Statement:**  
Write a query to print all prime numbers less than or equal to a given number **N**.  
The output must be a single line of prime numbers separated by an ampersand (`&`) instead of spaces.

---

## Input Format

- A single integer **N**, the upper limit (inclusive) for checking prime numbers.

---

## Sample Input

10

---

## Sample Output

2&3&5&7

---

## Explanation

For **N = 10**, the prime numbers less than or equal to 10 are: 2, 3, 5, and 7.  
Instead of spaces, the result must use `&` as the separator, giving the output:  

`2&3&5&7`

---

## Notes / Constraints

- 2 is the smallest prime number.  
- Output must be a single line string.  
- Separator **must** be the ampersand (`&`).  
- Edge case: If **N < 2**, the output should be empty.
